                <p>
                    The key factor to learn programming is <br>
                    The practical coding, how much you code <br>
                    The more you code the mor you learn;<br>
                    In the process of writing code you face <br>
                    problems and solving those problem helps <br>
                    you a lot to learn more and search for it <br>
                    that is why when I learn something I get <br>
                    into coding more than studying the theory; <br>
